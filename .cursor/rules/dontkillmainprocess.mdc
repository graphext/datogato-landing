By default don't need to test every UI change on a browser with a MCP unless the user ask for it. And never terminate the primary dev server bound to port 3000. If you need to run your own instance, launch it on a different port (e.g. 3001+) and shut down only the instance you started. Before killing any process, double-check the port to avoid touching 3000. If you use a MCP for browser before you finish please close the entire browser window so I don't have to do it later manually.
